## 3 - chat

This final exercise puts several of the previous pieces together and goes back to the roots of using node as a web server while illustrating some more advanced concepts like how to use npm, and how a simple chat app can be easily put together using a library like socket.io.

It also introduces a very common usage of node - that of a task runner - in the form of writing a simple gulpfile for the project, to transpile various static assets.

#### Creating a node project from scratch
This time around you'll be making a proper node app from scratch, the first thing to do is create an entry point for the app, so make a file called `index.js` in this folder.

Now open a command prompt, in this folder, and initialise a new node project using.
```sh
npm init
```
Take the default answer for each of the questions it asks you, and you'll find it makes you a `package.json` file in this folder, now we can start work on the gulpfile.
