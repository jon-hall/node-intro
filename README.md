## node-intro
This repo contains materials for an intro to node session which is intended to
give an overview of some of the different things that can be achieved using node.

>The content of this repo is not intended to explain the stuff shown in great depth, it's more of a top-level view to illustrate what can be done, rather than exactly *how* everything involved works.

> As such, feel free to either just checkout the 'completed' branch and play around with the code, or work through the README files if you want a more thorough explanation of what's going on in each example project.

#### Projects
Each folder contains a mini-project with it's own README which explains some of the concepts being illustrated, and how to complete each exercise, if you want to try it for yourself.  

Completed versions of each of the projects will be found on the `completed` branch if you just want to skip to a finished version and look at, or play with, the code.

Project walkthroughs:
 - [0-hello](0-hello/README.md)
 - [1-rename](1-rename/README.md)
 - [2-ffi](2-ffi/README.md)
 - [3-chat](3-chat/README.md)
