## node-intro
>This repo contains materials for an intro to node session which is intended to
give an overview of some of the different things that can be achieved using node.

The content of this repo is not intended to explain the stuff shown in great depth, it's more of a top-level view to illustrate what *can* be done, rather than exactly *how* it's done.

#### Projects
Each folder contains a mini-project with it's own README which explains some of the concepts being illustrated.  Completed versions of each of the projects will be found on the `completed` branch.

Additional links with further information will be added soon :).
